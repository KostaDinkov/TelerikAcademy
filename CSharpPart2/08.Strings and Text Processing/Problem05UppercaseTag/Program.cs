 * Lecture 8: Strings and Text processing
 * Problem 4: You are given a text. Write a program that changes the text in all 
 *              regions surrounded by the tags <upcase> and </upcase> to uppercase. 
 *              The tags cannot be nested. Example:
 *              We are living in a <upcase>yellow submarine</upcase>. 
 *              We don't have <upcase>anything</upcase> else.
 *              The expected result:
 *              We are living in a YELLOW SUBMARINE. We don't have ANYTHING else.
